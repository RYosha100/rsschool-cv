## **About me**

I am 43, been working as chemical engineer at [**Grodno Azot**](https://azot.by/en/) Chemical plant in Grodno Belarus for 20 years. My position is shift supervisor and I have 22 people under my command.

I graduated from [**Polotsk State University**](https://www.psu.by/en/) in 2000. I completed a five-year advanced English course with passing the TOEFL exam and received a diploma bout that during my studies.

I was  in the army for one year, served in command and intelligence center, part of my duties were translation and PC's.

Got also a hobby. It's photography and I am fond of working with different raw-converters as Capture One etc. I took part in some projects related to [**Phase One Capture One**](https://g.co/kgs/8SG3ro) featured software and now I've understood that JS knowledge is what I need to make my work going to higher level. That's my goal of learning in **RSSchool**.
