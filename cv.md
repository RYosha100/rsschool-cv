 ## About me
  I am 43, been working as chemical engineer at Azot Chemical plant in Grodno Belarus for 20 years. My position is shift supervisor and I have 22 people under my command.

I was  in the army and served in command and intelligence center.

I graduated from Polotsk State University in 2000. During my studies, I completed a five-year advanced English course and received a diploma bout that. 

Got also a hobby. It's photography and I am fond of working with different raw-converters as Capture One etc. I took part in some projects related to Phase One Capture One featured software and now I've understood that JS knowledge is what I need to make my work going to higher level. That's my goal of learning.
